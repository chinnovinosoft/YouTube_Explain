It is only through the development of infrastructure, \\nespecially at the post-harvest stage that the produce can be optimally utilized with \\nopportunity for value addition and fair deal for the farmers. Development of such \\ninfrastructure shall also address the vagaries of nature, the regional disparities, development \\nof human resource and realization of full potential of our limited land resource. \\n \\nIn view of above, the Hon’ble Finance Min ister announced on 15.05.2020, ₹1 lakh \\ncrore Agri Infrastructure Fund for farm -gate infrastructure for farmers. Financing facility of ₹ \\n1,00,000 crore will be provided for funding Agriculture Infrastructure Projects at farm-gate & \\naggregation points Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies, Farmers Producer \\nOrganizations, Agriculture entrepreneurs, Start -ups, etc.  Impetus for development of fa rm-\\ngate & aggregation point, affordable and financially viable Post Harvest Management \\ninfrastructure. \\n \\nAccordingly, DA&FW has formulated the Central Sector Scheme to mobilize a medium \\n- long term debt financing facility for investment in viable projects relating to post -harvest \\nmanagement Infrastructure and community farming assets through incentives and financial \\nsupport. \\n \\nSubsequently, in the budget announcement made on 01.02.2021, it was decided to \\nextend the benefit of the scheme to APMCs. Accordingly, modifications in the scheme were \\ncarried out with the approval of Cabinet to make it more inclusive. \\n \\n2 Rationale of the Scheme \\n \\nAgriculture and allied activities are the primary income source for ~58% of total \\npopulation of India. ~85% of the farmers are Small Holding Farmers (SHFs) with less than 2 \\nhectares of land under cultivation and manage ~45% of agricultural land. Annu al income of'),\n",

Further, India has limited infrastructure connecting \\nfarmers to markets and hence, 15 -20% of yield is wasted which is relatively high  in \\ncomparison to other countries where it ranges between 5 -15%. Investment in agriculture in \\nIndia has further been stagnant with less than 2% CAGR over last 5 years. Investment in \\nFY17 was ~ ₹ 2.19 lakh crore out of which private sector share was ~83% vs. a higher \\ninvestment of ~ ₹ 2.50 lakh crore in FY14 and a higher share of private sector at ~88%. Also, \\nlack of investor confidence is leading to lower plowback ratio (~14% of Gross Value addition \\nin FY18) vs. other sectors (~33% of Gross Value addition in FY18). \\n \\n3 Objectives of the Scheme \\n \\nTo mobilize a medium - long term debt financing  facility for investment in viable \\nprojects for post -harvest management Infrastructure and community farming assets through \\nincentives and financial support in order to improve agriculture infrastructure in the c ountry. \\nThis financing facility will fulfil numerous objectives for all the stakeholders in the agriculture \\neco-system. \\n \\na. Farmers (including FPOs, PACS, Marketing Cooperative Societies, Multipurpose  cooperative societies, \\nState Agencies, Agricultural Produce Market Committees  (Mandis), National & State Federations of \\nCooperatives, Federations of FPOs and Federations of Self Help Groups (SHGs) etc.). \\n- Improved marketing infrastructure to allow farmers to sell directly to a larger base \\nof consumers and hence, increase value realization for the farmers. This will \\nimprove the overall income of farmers. \\n- With investments in logistics infrastructure, farmers will be able to sell in the \\nmarket with reduced post-harvest losses and a smaller number of intermediaries. \\nThis further will make farmers independent through improved access to market. \\n- With modern packaging and cold storage system access, farmers will be able to \\nfurther decide when to sell in the market and improve realization. \\n- Community farming assets fo r improved productivity and optimization of inputs \\nwill result in substantial savings to farmers. \\n \\nb. Government \\n-  Government will be able to direct priority sector lending in the currently unviable \\nprojects by supporting through interest subvention, incentive through'),\n",

This will initiate the cycle of innovation and \\nprivate sector investment in agriculture. \\n- Due to improvements in post -harvest infrastructure, government will further be \\nable to reduce national food wastage  percentage thereby enable agriculture \\nsector to become competitive with current global levels. \\n- Central/State Government Agencies or local bodies will be able to structure \\nviable projects on their own or PPP projects for attracting investment in \\nagriculture infrastructure. \\n \\nc. Agri-entrepreneurs and startups \\n- With a dedicated source of funding, entrepreneurs will push for innovation in \\nagriculture sector by leveraging new age technologies including IoT, AI, etc. \\n- It will also connect the players in ecosystem and  hence, improve avenues for \\ncollaboration between entrepreneurs and farmers. \\n \\nd. Banking ecosystem \\n- With Credit Guarantee, convergence and interest subvention lending institutions \\nwill be able to lend with a lower risk. This scheme will help to enlarge their \\ncustomer base and diversification of portfolio. \\n- Refinance facility will enable larger role for cooperative banks and RRBs. \\n \\ne. Consumers \\n- With reduced inefficiencies in post-harvest ecosystem, key benefit for consumers \\nwill be a larger share of produce reaching  the market and hence, better quality \\nand prices.
