It has decreased tax incidence on the common man;\\nreduced compliance burden and logistics cost for trade and industry; and\\nenhanced revenues of the central and state governments.

To multiply the benefits of GST, we will strive to further\\nsimplify and rationalise the tax structure and endeavour to expand it to the\\nremaining sectors.\\n116. My proposals for customs duties intend to support domestic\\nmanufacturing, deepen local value addition, promote export\\ncompetitiveness, and simplify taxation, while keeping the interest of the\\ngeneral public and consumers surmount.\\n117. In Budget 2022-23, we reduced the number of customs duty rates.\\nI propose to undertake a comprehensive review of the rate structure over the\\nnext six months to rationalise and simplify it for ease of trade, removal of\\nduty inversion and reduction of disputes.\\n118.\\n\\nI shall now take up sector specific customs duty proposals.'),\n",

We are grateful for their support, faith and\\ntrust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless\\nof religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their\\nlife goals and aspirations.\\nGlobal Context\\n2.\\n\\nThe global economy, while performing better than expected, is still in\\n\\nthe grip of policy uncertainties. Elevated asset prices, political uncertainties\\nand shipping disruptions continue to pose significant downside risks for\\ngrowth and upside risks to inflation.\\n3.\\n\\nIn this context, India’s economic growth continues to be the shining\\n\\nexception and will remain so in the years ahead. India’s inflation continues to\\nbe low, stable and moving towards the 4 per cent target. Core inflation (nonfood, non-fuel) currently is 3.1 per cent. Steps are being taken to ensure\\nsupplies of perishable goods reach market adequately.\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nInterim Budget\\n4.\\nAs mentioned in the interim budget, we need to focus on 4 major\\ncastes, namely ‘Garib’ (Poor), ‘Mahilayen’ (Women), ‘Yuva’ (Youth) and\\n‘Annadata’ (Farmer). For Annadata, we announced higher Minimum Support\\nPrices a month ago for all major crops, delivering on the promise of at least a\\n50 per cent margin over costs. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was\\nextended for five years, benefitting more than 80 crore people.\\n5.\\nAdministrative actions for approval and implementation of various\\nschemes announced in the interim budget are well underway. The required\\nallocations have been made.\\nBudget Theme\\n6.\\nTurning attention to the full year and beyond, in this budget, we\\nparticularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. I am\\nhappy to announce the Prime Minister’s package of 5 schemes and initiatives\\nto facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth\\nover a 5-year period with a central outlay of ` 2 lakh crore. I will speak about\\nthem shortly, while more details may be seen in the annexure. This year, I\\nhave made a provision of ` 1.48 lakh crore for education, employment and\\nskilling.\\nBudget Priorities\\n7.\\nThe people have given a unique opportunity to our government to\\ntake the country on the path of strong development and all-round prosperity.\\nIn the interim budget, we promised to present a detailed roadmap for our\\npursuit of ‘Viksit Bharat’. In line with the strategy set out in the interim\\nbudget, this budget envisages sustained efforts on the following 9 priorities\\nfor generating ample opportunities for all.\\n1) Productivity and resilience in Agriculture\\n2) Employment & Skilling\\n3) Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice\\n4) Manufacturing & Services\\n5) Urban Development\\n6) Energy Security\\n7) Infrastructure\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n8) Innovation, Research & Development and\\n9) Next Generation Reforms\\n8.\\nSubsequent budgets will build on these, and add more priorities and\\nactions. A more detailed formulation will be carried out as part of the\\n‘economic policy framework’ about which I will speak later in this speech.\\n9.\\nThis budget details some of the specific actions to be initiated in the\\ncurrent year towards fulfilment of these priorities with potential for\\ntransformative changes. The budget also covers some of the previously\\nmade announcements with an intent to strengthen them and step up their\\nimplementation for expediting our journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.\\nPriority 1: Productivity and resilience in Agriculture\\nTransforming agriculture research\\n10.\\nOur government will undertake a comprehensive review of the\\nagriculture research setup to bring the focus on raising productivity and\\ndeveloping climate resilient varieties. Funding will be provided in challenge\\nmode, including to the private sector.

As announced in the\\ninterim budget, a strategy is being put in place to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’ for\\noil seeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower.\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nVegetable production & Supply Chains\\n14.\\nLarge scale clusters for vegetable production will be developed closer\\nto major consumption centres. We will promote Farmer-Producer\\nOrganizations, cooperatives and start-ups for vegetable supply chains\\nincluding for collection, storage, and marketing.\\nDigital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture\\n15.\\nBuoyed by the success of the pilot project, our government, in\\npartnership with the states, will facilitate the implementation of the Digital\\nPublic Infrastructure (DPI) in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their\\nlands in 3 years. During this year, digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI\\nwill be taken up in 400 districts. The details of 6 crore farmers and their lands\\nwill be brought into the farmer and land registries. Further, the issuance of\\nJan Samarth based Kisan Credit Cards will be enabled in 5 states.\\nShrimp Production & Export\\n16.\\nFinancial support for setting up a network of Nucleus Breeding\\nCentres for Shrimp Broodstocks will be provided.

These will be\\nbased on enrolment in the EPFO, and focus on recognition of first-time\\nemployees, and support to employees and employers.\\n\\n\\x0c5\\nScheme A: First Timers\\n20.\\nThis scheme will provide one-month wage to all persons newly\\nentering the workforce in all formal sectors. The direct benefit transfer of\\none-month salary in 3 instalments to first-time employees, as registered in\\nthe EPFO, will be up to ` 15,000. The eligibility limit will be a salary of\\n` 1 lakh per month. The scheme is expected to benefit 210 lakh youth.\\nScheme B: Job Creation in manufacturing\\n21.\\nThis scheme will incentivize additional employment in the\\nmanufacturing sector, linked to the employment of first-time employees. An\\nincentive will be provided at specified scale directly both to the employee\\nand the employer with respect to their EPFO contribution in the first 4 years\\nof employment. The scheme is expected to benefit 30 lakh youth entering\\nemployment, and their employers.\\nScheme C: Support to employers\\n22.\\nThis employer-focussed scheme will cover additional employment in\\nall sectors. All additional employment within a salary of ` 1 lakh per month\\nwill be counted. The government will reimburse to employers up to ` 3,000\\nper month for 2 years towards their EPFO contribution for each additional\\nemployee. The scheme is expected to incentivize additional employment of\\n50 lakh persons.\\nParticipation of women in the workforce\\n23.\\nWe will facilitate higher participation of women in the workforce\\nthrough setting up of working women hostels in collaboration with industry,\\nand establishing creches. In addition, the partnership will seek to organize\\nwomen-specific skilling programmes, and promotion of market access for\\nwomen SHG enterprises.\\nSkilling programme\\n24.\\nI am happy to announce a new centrally sponsored scheme, as the 4th\\nscheme under the Prime Minister’s package, for skilling in collaboration with\\nstate governments and Industry. 20 lakh youth will be skilled over a 5-year\\nperiod. 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes will be upgraded in hub and spoke\\narrangements with outcome orientation. Course content and design will be\\n\\n\\x0c6\\naligned to the skill needs of industry, and new courses will be introduced for\\nemerging needs.\\nSkilling Loans\\n25.\\nThe Model Skill Loan Scheme will be revised to facilitate loans up to\\n` 7.5 lakh with a guarantee from a government promoted Fund. This measure\\nis expected to help 25,000 students every year.\\nEducation Loans\\n26.\\nFor helping our youth who have not been eligible for any benefit\\nunder government schemes and policies, I am happy to announce a financial\\nsupport for loans upto ` 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions.\\nE-vouchers for this purpose will be given directly to 1 lakh students every\\nyear for annual interest subvention of 3 per cent of the loan amount.\\nPriority 3: Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice\\nSaturation approach\\n27.\\nOur government is committed to all-round, all-pervasive and allinclusive development of people, particularly, farmers, youth, women and\\npoor. For achieving social justice comprehensively, the saturation approach\\nof covering all eligible people through various programmes including those\\nfor education and health will be adopted to empower them by improving\\ntheir capabilities.\\n28.\\nImplementation of schemes meant for supporting economic activities\\nby craftsmen, artisans, self-help groups, scheduled caste, schedule tribe and\\nwomen entrepreneurs, and street vendors, such as PM Vishwakarma, PM\\nSVANidhi, National Livelihood Missions, and Stand-Up India will be stepped\\nup.\\nPurvodaya\\n29.\\nThe states in the Eastern part of the country are rich in endowments\\nand have strong cultural traditions. We will formulate a plan, Purvodaya, for\\nthe all-round development of the eastern region of the country covering\\nBihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. This will cover\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nhuman resource development, infrastructure, and generation of economic\\nopportunities to make the region an engine to attain Viksit Bharat.\\n30.\\nOn the Amritsar Kolkata Industrial Corridor, we will support\\ndevelopment of an industrial node at Gaya. This corridor will catalyze\\nindustrial development of the eastern region. The industrial node at Gaya will\\nalso be a good model for developing our ancient centres of cultural\\nimportance into future centres of modern economy. This model shall\\nshowcase “Vikas bhi Virasat bhi” in our growth trajectory.\\n31.\\nWe will also support development of road connectivity projects,\\nnamely (1) Patna-Purnea Expressway, (2) Buxar-Bhagalpur Expressway, (3)\\nBodhgaya, Rajgir, Vaishali and Darbhanga spurs, and (4) additional 2-lane\\nbridge over river Ganga at Buxar at a total cost of ` 26,000 crore. Power\\nprojects, including setting up of a new 2400 MW power plant at Pirpainti, will\\nbe taken up at a cost of ` 21,400 crore. New airports, medical colleges and\\nsports infrastructure in Bihar will be constructed.\\n32.\\nAn additional allocation to support capital investments will be\\nprovided. The requests of Bihar Government for external assistance from\\nmultilateral development banks will be expedited.\\nAndhra Pradesh Reorganization Act\\n33.\\nOur government has made concerted efforts to fulfil the\\ncommitments in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act. Recognizing the\\nstate’s need for a capital, we will facilitate special financial support through\\nmultilateral development agencies. In the current financial year ` 15,000\\ncrore will be arranged, with additional amounts in future years.\\n34.\\nOur government is fully committed to financing and early completion\\nof the Polavaram Irrigation Project, which is the lifeline for Andhra Pradesh\\nand its farmers. This will facilitate our country’s food security as well.\\n35.\\nUnder the Act, for promoting industrial development, funds will be\\nprovided for essential infrastructure such as water, power, railways and\\nroads in Kopparthy node on the Vishakhapatnam-Chennai Industrial Corridor\\nand Orvakal node on Hyderabad-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.

This signals our government’s commitment for enhancing women’s role\\nin economic development.\\nPradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan\\n39.\\nFor improving the socio-economic condition of tribal communities, we\\nwill launch the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan by adopting\\nsaturation coverage for tribal families in tribal-majority villages and\\naspirational districts. This will cover 63,000 villages benefitting 5 crore tribal\\npeople.\\nBank branches in North-Eastern Region\\n40.\\nMore than 100 branches of India Post Payment Bank will be set up in\\nthe North East region to expand the banking services.\\n41.\\nThis year, I have made a provision of ` 2.66 lakh crore for rural\\ndevelopment including rural infrastructure.\\nPriority 4: Manufacturing & Services\\nSupport for promotion of MSMEs\\n42.\\nThis budget provides special attention to MSMEs and manufacturing,\\nparticularly labour-intensive manufacturing. We have formulated a package\\ncovering financing, regulatory changes and technology support for MSMEs to\\nhelp them grow and also compete globally, as mentioned in the interim\\nbudget. I am happy to announce the following specific measures.\\n\\n\\x0c9\\nCredit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs in the Manufacturing Sector\\n43.\\nFor facilitating term loans to MSMEs for purchase of machinery and\\nequipment without collateral or third-party guarantee, a credit guarantee\\nscheme will be introduced. The scheme will operate on pooling of credit risks\\nof such MSMEs. A separately constituted self-financing guarantee fund will\\nprovide, to each applicant, guarantee cover up to ` 100 crore, while the loan\\namount may be larger. The borrower will have to provide an upfront\\nguarantee fee and an annual guarantee fee on the reducing loan balance.\\nNew assessment model for MSME credit\\n44.\\nPublic sector banks will build their in-house capability to assess\\nMSMEs for credit, instead of relying on external assessment. They will also\\ntake a lead in developing or getting developed a new credit assessment\\nmodel, based on the scoring of digital footprints of MSMEs in the economy.\\nThis is expected to be a significant improvement over the traditional\\nassessment of credit eligibility based only on asset or turnover criteria. That\\nwill also cover MSMEs without a formal accounting system.\\nCredit Support to MSMEs during Stress Period\\n45.\\nI am happy to announce a new mechanism for facilitating\\ncontinuation of bank credit to MSMEs during their stress period. While being\\nin the ‘special mention account’ (SMA) stage for reasons beyond their\\ncontrol, MSMEs need credit to continue their business and to avoid getting\\ninto the NPA stage. Credit availability will be supported through a guarantee\\nfrom a government promoted fund.\\nMudra Loans\\n46.\\nThe limit of Mudra loans will be enhanced to ₹ 20 lakh from the\\ncurrent ₹ 10 lakh for those entrepreneurs who have availed and successfully\\nrepaid previous loans under the ‘Tarun’ category.\\nEnhanced scope for mandatory onboarding in TReDS\\n47.\\nFor facilitating MSMEs to unlock their working capital by converting\\ntheir trade receivables into cash, I propose to reduce the turnover threshold\\nof buyers for mandatory onboarding on the TReDS platform from ` 500 crore\\nto ` 250 crore. This measure will bring 22 more CPSEs and 7000 more\\n\\n\\x0c10\\ncompanies onto the platform. Medium enterprises will also be included in\\nthe scope of the suppliers.\\nSIDBI branches in MSME clusters\\n48.\\nSIDBI will open new branches to expand its reach to serve all major\\nMSME clusters within 3 years, and provide direct credit to them.

The\\nscheme has generated remarkable response with more than 1.28 crore\\nregistrations and 14 lakh applications, and we will further encourage it.\\nPumped Storage Policy\\n74.\\nA policy for promoting pumped storage projects will be brought out\\nfor electricity storage and facilitating smooth integration of the growing\\nshare of renewable energy with its variable & intermittent nature in the\\noverall energy mix.\\nResearch and development of small and modular nuclear reactors\\n75.\\nNuclear energy is expected to form a very significant part of the\\nenergy mix for Viksit Bharat. Towards that pursuit, our government will\\npartner with the private sector for (1) setting up Bharat Small Reactors, (2)\\nresearch & development of Bharat Small Modular Reactor, and (3) research &\\ndevelopment of newer technologies for nuclear energy. The R&D funding\\nannounced in the interim budget will be made available for this sector.\\nAdvanced Ultra Super Critical Thermal Power Plants\\n76.\\nThe development of indigenous technology for Advanced Ultra Super\\nCritical (AUSC) thermal power plants with much higher efficiency has been\\ncompleted. A joint venture between NTPC and BHEL will set up a full scale\\n800 MW commercial plant using AUSC technology. The government will\\nprovide the required fiscal support. Moving forward, development of\\nindigenous capacity for the production of high-grade steel and other\\n\\n\\x0c15\\nadvanced metallurgy materials for these plants will result in strong spin-off\\nbenefits for the economy.\\nRoadmap for ‘hard to abate’ industries\\n77.\\nA roadmap for moving the ‘hard to abate’ industries from ‘energy\\nefficiency’ targets to ‘emission targets’ will be formulated. Appropriate\\nregulations for transition of these industries from the current ‘Perform,\\nAchieve and Trade’ mode to ‘Indian Carbon Market’ mode will be put in\\nplace.\\nSupport to traditional micro and small industries\\n78.\\nAn investment-grade energy audit of traditional micro and small\\nindustries in 60 clusters, including brass and ceramic, will be facilitated.\\nFinancial support will be provided for shifting them to cleaner forms of\\nenergy and implementation of energy efficiency measures. The scheme will\\nbe replicated in another 100 clusters in the next phase.\\nPriority 7: Infrastructure\\nInfrastructure investment by Central Government\\n79.\\nSignificant investment the Central Government has made over the years\\nin building and improving infrastructure has had a strong multiplier effect on the\\neconomy. We will endeavour to maintain strong fiscal support for infrastructure\\nover the next 5 years, in conjunction with imperatives of other priorities and\\nfiscal consolidation. This year, I have provided ` 11,11,111 crore for capital\\nexpenditure. This would be 3.4 per cent of our GDP.\\nInfrastructure investment by state governments\\n80.\\nWe will encourage states to provide support of similar scale for\\ninfrastructure, subject to their development priorities. A provision of ` 1.5\\nlakh crore for long-term interest free loans has been made this year also to\\nsupport the states in their resource allocation.\\nPrivate investment in infrastructure\\n81.\\nInvestment in infrastructure by private sector will be promoted\\nthrough viability gap funding and enabling policies and regulations. A marketbased financing framework will be brought out.\\n\\n\\x0c16\\nPradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)\\n82.\\nPhase IV of PMGSY will be launched to provide all-weather\\nconnectivity to 25,000 rural habitations which have become eligible in view\\nof their population increase.\\nIrrigation and Flood Mitigation\\n83.\\nBihar has frequently suffered from floods, many of them originating\\noutside the country. Plans to build flood control structures in Nepal are yet\\nto progress. Our government, through the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit\\nProgramme and other sources, will provide financial support for projects with\\nestimated cost of ` 11,500 crore such as the Kosi-Mechi intra-state link and\\n20 other ongoing and new schemes including barrages, river pollution\\nabatement and irrigation projects.

We will provide assistance to the state.\\n87.\\nRecently Sikkim witnessed devastating flash floods and landslides that\\nwreaked havoc across the state. Our Government will provide assistance to\\nthe state.\\nTourism\\n88.\\nTourism has always been a part of our civilization. Our efforts in\\npositioning India as a global tourist destination will also create jobs, stimulate\\ninvestments and unlock economic opportunities for other sectors. In addition\\nto the measures outlined in the interim budget, I propose the following\\nmeasures.\\n89.\\nVishnupad Temple at Gaya and Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya in\\nBihar are of immense spiritual significance. Comprehensive development of\\n\\n\\x0c17\\nVishnupad Temple Corridor and Mahabodhi Temple Corridor will be\\nsupported, modelled on the successful Kashi Vishwanath Temple Corridor, to\\ntransform them into world class pilgrim and tourist destinations.\\n90.\\nRajgir holds immense religious significance for Hindus, Buddhists and\\nJains. The 20th Tirthankara Munisuvrata temple in the Jain Temple complex\\nis ancient. The Saptharishi or the 7 hotsprings form a warm water\\nBrahmakund that is sacred. A comprehensive development initiative for\\nRajgir will be undertaken.\\n91.\\nOur government will support the development of Nalanda as a tourist\\ncentre besides reviving Nalanda University to its glorious stature.\\n92.\\nOdisha’s scenic beauty, temples, monuments, craftsmanship, wildlife\\nsanctuaries, natural landscapes and pristine beaches make it an ultimate\\ntourism destination.

These reforms will cover all factors of production,\\n\\n\\x0c18\\nnamely land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, and technology as an\\nenabler of improving total factor productivity and bridging inequality.\\n97.\\nEffective implementation of several of these reforms requires\\ncollaboration between the Centre and the states and building consensus, as\\ndevelopment of the country lies in development of the states. For promoting\\ncompetitive federalism and incentivizing states for faster implementation of\\nreforms, I propose to earmark a significant part of the 50-year interest-free\\nloan. Working with the states, we will initiate the following reforms.\\nLand-related reforms by state governments\\n98.\\nLand-related reforms and actions, both in rural and urban areas, will\\ncover (1) land administration, planning and management, and (2) urban\\nplanning, usage and building bylaws. These will be incentivized for\\ncompletion within the next 3 years through appropriate fiscal support.\\nRural Land related actions\\n99.\\nRural land related actions will include (1) assignment of Unique Land\\nParcel Identification Number (ULPIN) or Bhu-Aadhaar for all lands, (2)\\ndigitization of cadastral maps, (3) survey of map sub-divisions as per current\\nownership, (4) establishment of land registry, and (5) linking to the farmers\\nregistry. These actions will also facilitate credit flow and other agricultural\\nservices.\\nUrban Land related actions\\n100. Land records in urban areas will be digitized with GIS mapping. An IT\\nbased system for property record administration, updating, and tax\\nadministration will be established. These will also facilitate improving the\\nfinancial position of urban local bodies.\\nLabour related reforms\\nServices to Labour\\n101. Our government will facilitate the provision of a wide array of services\\nto labour, including those for employment and skilling. A comprehensive\\nintegration of e-shram portal with other portals will facilitate such one-stop\\nsolution. Open architecture databases for the rapidly changing labour\\n\\n\\x0c19\\nmarket, skill requirements and available job roles, and a mechanism to\\nconnect job-aspirants with potential employers and skill providers will be\\ncovered in these services.\\nShram Suvidha & Samadhan Portal\\n102. Shram Suvidha and Samadhan portals will be revamped to enhance\\nease of compliance for industry and trade.\\nCapital and entrepreneurship related reforms\\nFinancial sector vision and strategy\\n103. For meeting financing needs of the economy, our government will\\nbring out a financial sector vision and strategy document to prepare the\\nsector in terms of size, capacity and skills. This will set the agenda for the\\nnext 5 years and guide the work of the government, regulators, financial\\ninstitutions and market participants.\\nTaxonomy for climate finance\\n104. We will develop a taxonomy for climate finance for enhancing the\\navailability of capital for climate adaptation and mitigation. This will support\\nachievement of the country’s climate commitments and green transition.\\nVariable Capital Company structure\\n105. We will seek the required legislative approval for providing an\\nefficient and flexible mode for financing leasing of aircrafts and ships, and\\npooled funds of private equity through a ‘variable company structure’.\\nForeign Direct Investment and Overseas Investment\\n106. The rules and regulations for Foreign Direct Investment and Overseas\\nInvestments will be simplified to (1) facilitate foreign direct investments, (2)\\nnudge prioritization, and (3) promote opportunities for using Indian Rupee as\\na currency for overseas investments.\\nNPS Vatsalya\\n107. NPS-Vatsalya, a plan for contribution by parents and guardians for\\nminors will be started. On attaining the age of majority, the plan can be\\nconverted seamlessly into a normal NPS account.\\n\\n\\x0c20\\nUse of Technology\\n108.\\n\\nWe have successfully used technology for improving productivity and\\n\\nbridging inequality in our economy during the past 10 years. Public\\ninvestment in digital infrastructure and innovations by the private sector\\nhave helped in improving access of all citizens, particularly the common\\npeople, to market resources, education, health and services. We will step up\\nadoption of technology towards digitalization of the economy.\\nEase of Doing Business\\n109.\\n\\nFor enhancing ‘Ease of Doing Business’, we are already working on the\\n\\nJan Vishwas Bill 2.0. Further, states will be incentivized for implementation of\\ntheir Business Reforms Action Plans and digitalization.\\nData and Statistics\\n110.\\n\\nFor\\n\\nimproving\\n\\ndata\\n\\ngovernance,\\n\\ncollection,\\n\\nprocessing\\n\\nand\\n\\nmanagement of data and statistics, different sectoral data bases, including\\nthose established under the Digital India mission, will be utilized with active\\nuse of technology tools.\\nNew Pension Scheme (NPS)\\n111.\\n\\nThe Committee to review the NPS has made considerable progress in\\n\\nits work. I am happy that the Staff Side of the National Council of the Joint\\nConsultative Machinery for Central Government Employees have taken a\\nconstructive approach. A solution will be evolved which addresses the\\nrelevant issues while maintaining fiscal prudence to protect the common\\ncitizens.\\nBudget Estimates 2024-25\\n112. For the year 2024-25, the total receipts other than borrowings and\\nthe total expenditure are estimated at ` 32.07 lakh crore and ` 48.21 lakh\\ncrore respectively. The net tax receipts are estimated at ` 25.83 lakh crore.\\nThe fiscal deficit is estimated at 4.9 per cent of GDP.\\n\\n\\x0c21\\n113. The gross and net market borrowings through dated securities during\\n2024-25 are estimated at ` 14.01 lakh crore and ` 11.63 lakh crore\\nrespectively. Both will be less than that in 2023-24.\\n114. The fiscal consolidation path announced by me in 2021 has served our\\neconomy very well, and we aim to reach a deficit below 4.5 per cent next\\nyear. The Government is committed to staying the course. From 2026-27\\nonwards, our endeavour will be to keep the fiscal deficit each year such that\\nthe Central Government debt will be on a declining path as percentage of\\nGDP.\\nI will, now, move to Part B.\\n\\n\\x0c22\\n\\nPART B\\nIndirect Taxes\\n115. I start with GST. It has decreased tax incidence on the common man;\\nreduced compliance burden and logistics cost for trade and industry; and\\nenhanced revenues of the central and state governments. It is a success of\\nvast proportions. To multiply the benefits of GST, we will strive to further\\nsimplify and rationalise the tax structure and endeavour to expand it to the\\nremaining sectors.\\n116. My proposals for customs duties intend to support domestic\\nmanufacturing, deepen local value addition, promote export\\ncompetitiveness, and simplify taxation, while keeping the interest of the\\ngeneral public and consumers surmount.\\n117. In Budget 2022-23, we reduced the number of customs duty rates.\\nI propose to undertake a comprehensive review of the rate structure over the\\nnext six months to rationalise and simplify it for ease of trade, removal of\\nduty inversion and reduction of disputes.\\n118.\\n\\nI shall now take up sector specific customs duty proposals.\\n\\nMedicines and Medical Equipment\\n119. To provide relief to cancer patients, I propose to fully exempt three\\nmore medicines from customs duties.\\n120. I also propose changes in the BCD on x-ray tubes & flat panel\\ndetectors for use in medical x-ray machines under the Phased Manufacturing\\nProgramme, so as to synchronise them with domestic capacity addition.\\nMobile Phone and Related Parts\\n121. With a three-fold increase in domestic production and almost\\n100-fold jump in exports of mobile phones over the last six years, the Indian\\nmobile phone industry has matured. In the interest of consumers, I now\\npropose to reduce the BCD on mobile phone, mobile PCBA and mobile\\ncharger to 15 per cent.\\n\\n\\x0c23\\nCritical Minerals\\n122.\\n\\nMinerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements are\\n\\ncritical for sectors like nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defence,\\ntelecommunications, and high-tech electronics. I propose to fully exempt\\ncustoms duties on 25 critical minerals and reduce BCD on two of them. This\\nwill provide a major fillip to the processing and refining of such minerals and\\nhelp secure their availability for these strategic and important sectors.\\nSolar Energy\\n123.\\n\\nEnergy transition is critical in the fight against climate change. To\\n\\nsupport energy transition, I propose to expand the list of exempted capital\\ngoods for use in the manufacture of solar cells and panels in the country.\\nFurther, in view of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity of solar glass\\nand tinned copper interconnect, I propose not to extend the exemption of\\ncustoms duties provided to them.\\nMarine products\\n124.\\n\\nIndia’s seafood exports in the last financial year touched an all-time\\n\\nhigh of more than ₹ 60,000 crore. Frozen shrimp accounted for about\\ntwo-thirds of these exports. To enhance their competitiveness, I propose to\\nreduce BCD on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp and fish feed\\nto 5 per cent. I also propose to exempt customs duty on various inputs for\\nmanufacture of shrimp and fish feed.\\nLeather and Textile\\n125.\\n\\nSimilarly, to enhance the competitiveness of exports in the leather\\n\\nand textile sectors, I propose to reduce BCD on real down filling material\\nfrom duck or goose. I am also making additions to the list of exempted goods\\nfor manufacture of leather and textile garments, footwear and other leather\\narticles for export.\\n126. To rectify inversion in duty, I propose to reduce BCD, subject to\\nconditions, on methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) for manufacture of\\nspandex yarn from 7.5 to 5 per cent.\\n\\n\\x0c24\\n127. Furthermore, the export duty structure on raw hides, skins and\\nleather is proposed to be simplified and rationalized.\\nPrecious Metals\\n128. To enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal\\njewellery in the country, I propose to reduce customs duties on gold and\\nsilver to 6 per cent and that on platinum to 6.4 per cent.\\nOther Metals\\n129. Steel and copper are important raw materials. To reduce their cost of\\nproduction, I propose to remove the BCD on ferro nickel and blister copper. I\\nam also continuing with nil BCD on ferrous scrap and nickel cathode and\\nconcessional BCD of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap.\\nElectronics\\n130. To increase value addition in the domestic electronics industry,\\nI propose to remove the BCD, subject to conditions, on oxygen free copper\\nfor manufacture of resistors. I also propose to exempt certain parts for\\nmanufacture of connectors.\\nChemicals and Petrochemicals\\n131. To support existing and new capacities in the pipeline, I propose to\\nincrease the BCD on ammonium nitrate from 7.5 to 10 per cent.\\nPlastics\\n132. PVC flex banners are non-biodegradable and hazardous for\\nenvironment and health. To curb their imports, I propose to raise the BCD on\\nthem from 10 to 25 per cent.\\nTelecommunication Equipment\\n133. To incentivise domestic manufacturing, I propose to increase the BCD\\nfrom 10 to 15 per cent on PCBA of specified telecom equipment.\\nTrade facilitation\\n134. To promote domestic aviation and boat & ship MRO, I propose to\\nextend the period for export of goods imported for repairs from six months\\nto one year. In the same vein, I propose to extend the time-limit for re-import\\nof goods for repairs under warranty from three to five years.\\n\\n\\x0c25\\n\\nDirect Taxes\\n135. We will continue our efforts to simplify taxes, improve tax payer\\nservices, provide tax certainty and reduce litigation while enhancing revenues\\nfor funding the development and welfare schemes of the government.\\n136. It has been our endeavour to simplify taxation. We have taken a\\nnumber of measures in the last few years including introduction of simplified\\ntax regimes without exemptions and deductions for corporate tax and\\npersonal income tax. This has been appreciated by tax payers. 58 per cent of\\ncorporate tax came from the simplified tax regime in financial year 2022-23.\\nSimilarly, as per data available till now for the last fiscal, more than twothirds have availed the new personal income tax regime.\\nComprehensive Review of the Income-tax Act, 1961\\n137. I am now announcing a comprehensive review of the Income-tax Act,\\n1961. The purpose is to make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and\\nunderstand. This will reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax\\ncertainty to the tax payers. It will also bring down the demand embroiled in\\nlitigation. It is proposed to be completed in six months.\\n138. A beginning is being made in the Finance Bill by simplifying the tax\\nregime for charities, TDS rate structure, provisions for reassessment and\\nsearch provisions and capital gains taxation.\\nSimplification for Charities and of TDS\\n139. The two tax exemption regimes for charities are proposed to be\\nmerged into one. The 5 per cent TDS rate on many payments is being merged\\ninto the 2 per cent TDS rate and the 20 per cent TDS rate on repurchase of\\nunits by mutual funds or UTI is being withdrawn. TDS rate on e-commerce\\noperators is proposed to be reduced from one to 0.1 per cent. Moreover,\\ncredit of TCS is proposed to be given in the TDS to be deducted on salary.\\nFurther, I propose to decriminalize delay for payment of TDS up to the due\\ndate of filing statement for the same. I also plan to provide a standard\\noperating procedure for TDS defaults and simplify and rationalise the\\ncompounding guidelines for such defaults.\\n\\n\\x0c26\\nSimplification of Reassessment\\n140. I propose to thoroughly simplify the provisions for reopening and\\nreassessment. An assessment hereinafter can be reopened beyond three\\nyears from the end of the assessment year only if the escaped income is\\n₹ 50 lakh or more, up to a maximum period of five years from the end of the\\nassessment year. Even in search cases, a time limit of six years before the\\nyear of search, as against the existing time limit of ten years, is proposed.\\nThis will reduce tax-uncertainty and disputes.\\nSimplification and Rationalisation of Capital Gains\\n141.\\n\\nCapital gains taxation is also proposed to be hugely simplified.\\n\\n142. Short term gains on certain financial assets shall henceforth attract a\\ntax rate of 20 per cent, while that on all other financial assets and all\\nnon-financial assets shall continue to attract the applicable tax rate.\\n143. Long term gains on all financial and non-financial assets, on the other\\nhand, will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent. For the benefit of the lower and\\nmiddle-income classes, I propose to increase the limit of exemption of capital\\ngains on certain financial assets to ₹ 1.25 lakh per year.\\n144. Listed financial assets held for more than a year will be classified as\\nlong term, while unlisted financial assets and all non-financial assets will have\\nto be held for at least two years to be classified as long-term.\\n145. Unlisted bonds and debentures, debt mutual funds and market linked\\ndebentures, irrespective of holding period, however, will attract tax on\\ncapital gains at applicable rates.\\nTax Payer Services\\n146. All the major tax payer services under GST and most services under\\nCustoms and Income Tax have been digitalised. All remaining services of\\nCustoms and Income Tax including rectification and order giving effect to\\nappellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper-less over the next two\\nyears.\\nLitigation and Appeals\\n147. While our concerted efforts to reduce pendency of appeals at various\\nappellate fora are beginning to show good results, it will continue to engage\\nour highest attention.\\n\\n\\x0c27\\n148. To dispose of the backlog of first appeals, I plan to deploy more\\nofficers to hear and decide such appeals, especially those with large tax\\neffect.\\n149. For resolution of certain income tax disputes pending in appeal, I am\\nalso proposing Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme, 2024.\\n150. Further, I propose to increase monetary limits for filing appeals\\nrelated to direct taxes, excise and service tax in the Tax Tribunals, High Courts\\nand Supreme Court to ₹ 60 lakh, ₹ 2 crore and ₹ 5 crore respectively.\\n151. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international\\ntaxation, we will expand the scope of safe harbour rules and make them\\nmore attractive. We will also streamline the transfer pricing assessment\\nprocedure.\\nEmployment and Investment\\n152. I have a few proposals to promote\\nemployment.\\n\\ninvestment and foster\\n\\n153. First of all, to bolster the Indian start-up eco-system, boost the\\nentrepreneurial spirit and support innovation, I propose to abolish the socalled angel tax for all classes of investors.\\n154. Second, there is tremendous potential for cruise tourism in India. To\\ngive a fillip to this employment generating industry, I am proposing a simpler\\ntax regime for foreign shipping companies operating domestic cruises in the\\ncountry.\\n155. Third, India is a world leader in the diamond cutting and polishing\\nindustry, which employs a large number of skilled workers. To further\\npromote the development of this sector, we would provide for safe harbour\\nrates for foreign mining companies selling raw diamonds in the country.\\n156. Fourth, to attract foreign capital for our development needs,\\nI propose to reduce the corporate tax rate on foreign companies from 40 to\\n35 per cent.\\n\\n\\x0c28\\nDeepening the tax base\\n157. I have a couple of proposals for deepening the tax base. First, Security\\nTransactions Tax on futures and options of securities is proposed to be\\nincreased to 0.02 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. Second, for reasons\\nof equity, I propose to tax income received on buy back of shares in the\\nhands of the recipient.\\nOthers\\n158. To improve social security benefits, deduction of expenditure by\\nemployers towards NPS is proposed to be increased from 10 to 14 per cent of\\nthe employee’s salary. Similarly, deduction of this expenditure up to 14 per\\ncent of salary from the income of employees in private sector, public sector\\nbanks and undertakings, opting for the new tax regime, is proposed to be\\nprovided.\\n159. Indian professionals working in multinationals get ESOPs and invest in\\nsocial security schemes and other movable assets abroad. Non-reporting of\\nsuch small foreign assets has penal consequences under the Black Money\\nAct. Such non-reporting of movable assets up to ₹ 20 lakh is proposed to be\\nde-penalised.\\n160.\\n\\nOther major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to:\\n•\\n\\nWithdrawal of equalization levy of 2 per cent;\\n\\n•\\n\\nExpansion of tax benefits to certain funds and entities in IFSCs; and\\n\\n•\\n\\nimmunity from penalty and prosecution to benamidar on full and\\ntrue disclosure so as to improve conviction under the Benami\\nTransactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988.\\n\\nPersonal Income Tax\\n161. Coming to Personal Income Tax Rates, I have two announcements to\\nmake for those opting for the new tax regime. First, the standard deduction\\nfor salaried employees is proposed to be increased from ₹50,000/- to\\n₹75,000/-. Similarly, deduction on family pension for pensioners is proposed\\nto be enhanced from ₹ 15,000/- to ₹ 25,000/-. This will provide relief to\\nabout four crore salaried individuals and pensioners.\\n\\n\\x0c29\\n162. Second, in the new tax regime, the tax rate structure is proposed to\\nbe revised, as follows:\\n0-3 lakh rupees\\n\\nNil\\n\\n3-7 lakh rupees\\n\\n5 per cent\\n\\n7-10 lakh rupees\\n\\n10 per cent\\n\\n10-12 lakh rupees\\n\\n15 per cent\\n\\n12-15 lakh rupees\\n\\n20 per cent\\n\\nAbove 15 lakh rupees\\n\\n30 per cent\\n\\nAs a result of these changes, a salaried employee in the new tax regime\\nstands to save up to ₹ 17,500/- in income tax.\\n163. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in\\nthe annexure.\\n164. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ₹ 37,000 crore –\\n₹ 29,000 crore in direct taxes and ₹ 8,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be\\nforgone while revenue of about ₹ 30,000 crore rupees will be additionally\\nmobilized. Thus, the total revenue forgone is about ₹ 7,000 crore annually.\\n165.
