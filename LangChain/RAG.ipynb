Though my charms are now \\nconsiderably softened and somewhat impaired by the misfortunes I \\nhave undergone, I was once beautiful. But lovely as I was, the graces of \\nmy person were the least of my perfections. Of every accomplishment \\naccustomary to my sex, I was mistress. When in the convent, my \\nprogress had always exceeded my instructions, my acquirements had \\nbeen wonderful for my age, and I had shortly surpassed my masters.\\nIn my mind, every virtue that could adorn it was centred; it was the \\nrendezvous of every good quality and of every noble sentiment.\\nA sensibility too tremblingly alive to every affliction of my friends, \\nmy acquaintance, and particularly to every affliction of my own, \\nwas my fault, if a fault it could be called. Alas! how altered now! \\nThough indeed my own misfortunes do not make less impression on \\nme than they ever did, yet now I never feel for those of another.

Isabel had seen the world. She had \\npassed two years at one of the first boarding-schools in London, had \\nspent a fortnight in Bath, and had supped one night in Southampton.\\n“Beware, my Laura,” she would often say . “Beware of the insipid \\nvanities and idle dissipations of the metropolis of England; beware '),\n",

She received me with equal surprise, though not with equal \\ncordiality , as Philippa. There was a disagreeable coldness and forbidding \\nreserve in her reception of me which was equally distressing and \\nunexpected: none of that interesting sensibility or amiable sympathy \\nin her manners and address to me when we first met which should \\nhave distinguished our introduction to each other… Her language was \\nneither warm, nor affectionate, her expressions of regard were neither \\nanimated nor cordial; her arms were not opened to receive me to her \\nheart, though my own were extended to press her to mine.\\nA short conversation between Augusta and her brother, which I \\naccidentally overheard, increased my dislike of her and convinced me \\nthat her heart was no more formed of the soft ties of love than for the \\nendearing intercourse of friendship.\\n“But do you think that my father will ever be reconciled to this \\nimprudent connection?” said Augusta.\\n“ Augusta,” replied the noble youth, “I thought you had a better \\nopinion of me than to imagine I would so abjectly degrade myself as \\nto consider my father’s concurrence in any of my affairs either of con-\\nsequence or concern to me… Tell me, Augusta, with sincerity: did you \\never know me consult his inclinations or follow his advice in the least \\ntrifling particular since the age of fifteen?”\\n“Edward,” replied she, you are surely too diffident in your own \\npraise… Since you were fifteen only!… My dear brother, since you were \\nfive years old, I entirely acquit you of ever having willingly contributed \\nto the satisfaction of your father.

Can you not conceive the luxury of \\nliving in every distress that poverty can inflict, with the object of your \\ntenderest affection?”\\n“Y ou are too ridiculous,” said Augusta, “to argue with; perhaps how-\\never you may in time be convinced that—”\\nHere I was prevented from hearing the remainder of her speech by the \\nappearance of a very handsome young woman who was ushered into the \\nroom at the door of which I had been listening.

Though certainly nothing could, to any reasonable \\nbeing, have appeared more satisfactory than so grateful a reply to \\nher invitation, yet I know not how it was, but she was certainly \\ncapricious enough to be displeased with our behaviour, and in a few \\nweeks after, either to revenge our conduct or relieve her own solitude, \\nmarried a young and illiterate fortune-hunter. This imprudent step \\n(though we were sensible that it would probably deprive us of that \\nfortune which Philippa had ever taught us to expect) could not on \\nour own accounts excite from our exalted minds a single sigh; yet \\nfearful lest it might prove a source of endless misery to the deluded \\nbride, our trembling sensibility was greatly affected when we were \\nfirst informed of the event. The affectionate entreaties of Augustus \\nand Sophia that we would for ever consider their house as our home \\neasily prevailed on us to determine never more to leave them… In \\nthe society of my Edward and this amiable pair I passed the happiest \\nmoments of my life: our time was most delightfully spent in mutual \\nprotestations of friendship and in vows of unalterable love, in which \\nwe were secure from being interrupted by intruding and disagreeable \\nvisitors as Augustus and Sophia had, on their first entrance in the \\nneighbourhood, taken due care to inform the surrounding families \\nthat, as their happiness centred wholly in themselves, they wished for \\nno other society .'),\n",

Y es, yes, I see \\nyou are the daughter of my Laurina’s eldest girl; your resemblance to \\nthe beauteous Matilda sufficiently proclaims it.”\\n“Oh!” replied Sophia, “when I first beheld you the instinct of nature \\nwhispered me that we were in some degree related – but whether grand-\\nfathers or grandmothers, I could not pretend to determine.”\\nHe folded her in his arms, and whilst they were tenderly embracing, \\nthe door of the apartment opened and a most beautiful young man \\nappeared. On perceiving him Lord St Clair started, and retreating back \\na few paces, with uplifted hands, said, “ Another grandchild! What an \\nunexpected happiness is this! T o discover in the space of three minutes \\nas many of my descendants! This I am certain is Philander, the son of my \\nLaurina’s third girl, the amiable Bertha; there wants now but the presence \\nof Gustavus to complete the union of my Laurina’s grandchildren.”\\n“ And here he is,” said a graceful youth, who that instant entered the \\nroom. “Here is the Gustavus you desire to see. I am the son of Agatha, \\nyour Laurina’s fourth and youngest daughter.”\\n“I see you are indeed,” replied Lord St Clair. “But tell me,” continued \\nhe, looking fearfully towards the door, “tell me, have I any other grand-\\nchildren in the house?”'),\n",

How long we remained in this situation I know not, but when \\nwe recovered we found ourselves alone, without either Gustavus, \\nPhilander, or the banknotes.\\nAs we were deploring our unhappy fate, the door of the apartment \\nopened and “Macdonald” was announced. He was Sophia’s cousin. \\nThe haste with which he came to our relief so soon after the receipt \\nof our note spoke so greatly in his favour that I hesitated not to \\npronounce him, at first sight, a tender and sympathetic friend. \\nAlas! he little deserved the name – for though he told us that he \\nwas much concerned at our misfortunes, yet by his own account it \\nappeared that the perusal of them had neither drawn from him a \\nsingle sigh, nor induced him to bestow one curse on our vindictive \\nstars.\\nHe told Sophia that his daughter depended on her returning with \\nhim to Macdonald Hall, and that as his cousin’s friend he should \\nbe happy to see me there also. T o Macdonald Hall, therefore, we \\nwent, and were received with great kindness by Janetta, the daughter \\nof Macdonald, and the mistress of the mansion. Janetta was then \\nonly fifteen; naturally well disposed, endowed with a susceptible \\nheart, and a sympathetic disposition, she might, had these amia -\\nble qualities been properly encouraged, have been an ornament to \\nhuman nature; but unfortunately her father possessed not a soul \\nsufficiently exalted to admire so promising a disposition, and had \\nendeavoured by every means in his power to prevent it increasing in '),\n",

He had actually so far extinguished the natural noble sensibility \\nof her heart as to prevail on her to accept an offer from a young man \\nof his recommendation. They were to be married in a few months, \\nand Graham was in the house when we arrived. W e soon saw through \\nhis character…\\nHe was just such a man as one might have expected to be the choice of \\nMacdonald. They said he was sensible, well informed, and agreeable; \\nwe did not pretend to judge of such trifles, but as we were convinced he \\nhad no soul, that he had never read the Sorrows of  W erther ,* and that \\nhis hair bore not the least resemblance to auburn, we were certain that \\nJanetta could feel no affection for him, or at least that she ought to feel \\nnone. The very circumstance of his being her father’s choice, too, was \\nso much in his disfavour that, had he been deserving her in every other \\nrespect, yet that of itself ought to have been a sufficient reason in the \\neyes of Janetta for rejecting him.\\nThese considerations we were determined to represent to her in \\nproper light, and doubted not of meeting with the desired success \\nfrom one naturally so well disposed; whose errors in the affair had \\nonly arisen from a want of proper confidence in her own opinion, and \\na suitable contempt of her father’s. We found her, indeed, all that our \\nwarmest wishes could have hoped for; we had no difficulty to convince \\nher that it was impossible she could love Graham, or that it was her \\nduty to disobey her father; the only thing at which she rather seemed \\nto hesitate was our assertion that she must be attached to some other \\nperson. For some time she persevered in declaring that she knew no \\nother young man for whom she had the smallest affection; but upon \\nexplaining the impossibility of such a thing she said that she believed \\nshe did like  Captain M’Kenrie better than anyone she knew besides. \\nThis confession satisfied us and, after having enumerated the good \\nqualities of M’Kenrie and assured her that she was violently in love \\nwith him, we desired to know whether he had ever in any wise declared \\nhis affection to her.\\n“So far from having ever declared it, I have no reason to imagine that \\nhe has ever felt any for me,” said Janetta.\\n“That he certainly adores you,” replied Sophia, “there can be no \\ndoubt… The attachment must be reciprocal… Did he never gaze on \\nyou with admiration – tenderly press your hand – drop an involuntary \\ntear – and leave the room abruptly?”')]"
