The S&P 500 Index serves as a vital benchmark for evaluating both individual stocks like NVIDIA and overall market performance. Investors often compare the returns of individual investments against the index to gauge relative performance. Given NVIDIA's premium valuation metrics, like its PE ratio being in line with sector averages, it is essential to consider both the index's performance and NVIDIA's specific metrics to make informed investment decisions."
